OK, let's say you've defined a triangle (polygon) which looks
something like this:

     P1 -
        -----
        ---------
        -------------
        ----------------- P2
        ---------------
        -------------
        -----------
        ---------
        -------
        -----
        ---
        -
        P3

P1, P2 and P3 are the X and Y coordinates of the polygon's three corners.

You've come to the conclusion that the poly looks very dull when filled
with a constant color all the time. So let's take a look at how we can
SHADE it using some simple color interpolation.

Since you've already written a polygon filler, I assume you already are
familiar with the concepts of interpolation (Otherwise; shame on you
for ripping someone else's source code ;-] ). What we do is assign each
corner in the polygon a color. Then, as we draw the polygon, we
INTERPOLATE from one color to the other.

P1.color = 16
P2.color = 32
P3.color = 63

First, we calculate the X step value (how much to increase the color value
between each X coordinate) from P1.X to P2.X:

Delta.color     = P2.color - P1.color
Delta.X         = P2.X     - P1.X
Step.X          = (Delta.color shl 16) / Delta.X

But we also need to know the Step.Y value, since we are gonna draw several
lines, not just one. So we have to account for the amount of lines this
color "transformation" will take.

dc.left         = P3.color - P1.color
Delta.Y         = P3.Y     - P1.Y
Stepl.Y         = (dc.left shl 16) / Delta.Y

dc.right        = P2.color - P1.color
Delta.Y         = P2.Y     - P1.Y
Stepr.Y         = (dc.right shl 16) / Delta.Y
